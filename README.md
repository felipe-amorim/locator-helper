###### This solution is to help find elements on webdrivers using System.in, since there are no (at least that I'm aware of) extensions to find locators on IE, it is not ideal and may present issues, however, you can easily implement navigations and it gives you a quick response/highlight the elements.

###### As you type the locators on the terminal, it will highlight the current elements in red and all previous elements found will be highlighted in orange with a thinner line.

###### Hope it helps

Examples:

In this image, the locator found a single element

[![Example of a single element returned](https://i.stack.imgur.com/7vf54.png "Example of a single element returned")](https://i.stack.imgur.com/7vf54.png "Example of a single element returned")

In this image, the locator found 20 elements
